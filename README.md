**Repository containing AI and Machine Learning learning materials and a simple implementation example.**

## About this repository
This repository is a collection of resources to help you get started with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine  (ML). It includes:

- A set of learning materials that provide an overview of AI and ML concepts, along with links to recommended tutorials and documentation.
- A simple example implementation (see [simple_example.py](simple_example.py)) that demonstrates training a basic model on a sample dataset.

## Learning Resources

- [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) – essential for understanding the language used in most AI/ML projects.
- [Scikit‑learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) – an accessible machine‑learning library for Python.
- [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) – a comprehensive course covering neural networks and deep learning.
- [Machine Learning Crash Course by Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) – free interactive lessons with exercises.

Feel free to explore these resources to build a solid foundation in AI and ML.

## Running the example

The file `simple_example.py` contains a basic example that loads the Iris dataset, trains a classifier, and evaluates its performance. To run it, make sure you have Python 3 and the required libraries installed (`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`) and execute:

```bash
python simple_example.py
```

This will print the m
odel’s accuracy and display a simple scatter plot. You can use this script as a starting point for your own experiments.
